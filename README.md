## üîç Overview

Traditional centralized workflow engines suffer from:
- Bottlenecks  
- Single points of failure  
- Poor scalability in distributed cloud settings  

ADWEF.Cloud addresses these challenges by:
- Executing **decentralized workflows** across virtual machines (VMs)
- Dynamically adapting **workflow fragmentation** to runtime conditions
- Using **fuzzy logic** to manage **fragment-proportionality** and **available-bandwidth**

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **ADWEF Framework**: Runtime-adaptable orchestration layer
- **Fragment-Proportionality**: Number of workflow fragments aligned with available VMs
- **Bandwidth Adaptability**: Fragmentation responds to network communication capacity
- **Fuzzy Decision-Making (FDDM)**: Intelligent rule-based selection of fragmentation strategy
- **Improved Performance**:
  - Up to **97% improvement** in response time
  - Up to **306% boost** in throughput
  - Up to **93% reduction** in message exchange volume

## üìä Experimental Setup

- **Platform**: CloudSim-based simulation
- **Workflows**: Reference loan application process (BPEL, block-structured)
- **Metrics**: Response time, throughput, bandwidth usage, exchanged messages
- **Conditions**:
  - Variable number of VMs
  - Variable and constant bandwidth scenarios
  - Comparison against fully decentralized (FPD) and HPD baselines
